Odin Recipes
    An HTML project that is part of The Odin Project's HTML lessons.

    I am Mark Elliott, and I am currently following along with the Odin 
    Project. I have reached the Project: Recipes part of the 
    Foundations Course. In this project, I will be creating a website
    out of all the HTML knowledge I have learned thus far, which does not
    include CSS or Javascript. I hope that this website demonstrates my 
    knowledge of relative and absolute linking, tags, attributes, and 
    well-formatted, logical, readable markup language. I also intend to make 
    extensive use of the command line when possible, using commands such 
    as mkdir, rm, cp, mv, gh, and git. Evidence of its use will not be 
    visible in the code of this project but will further enhance my 
    confidence and capabilities with the terminal. When I have questions 
    or ideas on how to create something with HTML or the command line that 
    is not within the material or scope of the Odin Project, I will search 
    outside on Stack Overflow and Google to expand my knowledge and skills.
