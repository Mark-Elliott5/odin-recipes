Odin Recipes
    An HTML project that is part of The Odin Project's HTML lessons.

    I am Mark Elliott, and I am currently following along with the Odin 
    Project. I have reached the Project: Recipes part of the 
    Foundations Course. In this project, I will be creating a website
    out of all the HTML knowledge I have learned thus far. I hope that 
    this website demonstrates my knowledge of relative and absolute 
    linking, tags, attributes, and well-formatted code and overall 
    practice. I also intend to make exclusive use of the command line
    when possible, which will not be visible in the code of this project,
    but it will further enhance my abilities.
