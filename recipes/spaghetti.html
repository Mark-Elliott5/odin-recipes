            &emsp;&emsp;Spaghetti is a popular Italian dish that is easy 
            to make just like macaroni and cheese. It involves noodles, beef, 
            and tomato sauce. So simple, yet so tasty.

        <h2>&emsp;Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Boil your spaghetti noodles in water with 1 tablespoon of salt for 
                    12 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While your noodles are boiling, take your ground beef and 
                    cook it in a pan. Make sure to break the ground beef up 
                    into fine pieces as you cook it with your utensil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add spaghetti sauce to the ground beef and cook it a little 
                    more so that the sauce is the same temperature as the beef.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drain noodles and add the ground beef. Now it's ready to 
                    serve.
                </li>
            </ol>
